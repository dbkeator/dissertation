\chapter{What is Context?}

This chapter provides an overview on the term `Context'. What do we mean by it? How have different communities used context to find solution to their problems? And what precisely does context mean for the purposes of this dissertation?

\section{Introduction}

In his seminal paper, Anind Dey [CITE] describes context \textit{as any information that can be used to characterize the situation of an entity. An entity is a person, place or object that is considered relevant to the interaction between a user and an application, including the user and applications themselves.} He proceeds to explain this definition with the example of an ``indoor mobile tour", arguing that there are there are two additional pieces of information which can be used: \textit{weather} and \textit{presence of other people}. if the user is present with his friends, they might visist sites that are of interest to everybody. There the presence of other people is important context. Because the tour is indoor, weather does not affect the application. It is true that the weather has no direct affect on the application but what about the following scenarios:

\begin{itemize}
\item Could we use the weather information to serve different drinks in the cafeteria? On a cold day, placing the hot chocolate kiosk next to the entrance and the ice cream kiosk closer on a warmer day might boost some sales? And add to the overall experience of the tourists?
\item If the tour is similar to Alcatraz, where a ferry ride takes people to the island, and back from it? A storm brewing in the ocean could lead to disrputed ferry services? Should the application warn its users who are touring at this time? Or should they continue the tour at the same pace, miss the last ferry and spend the night at Alcatraz? After all, there is a personal room for everyone.
\end{itemize}

They then proceed to define Context-Aware computing as follows: \textit{A system is context-aware if it uses context to provide relevant information and/or services to the user, where relevancy depends on the user's tasks}. But, we need to ask ourselves why a system which uses this ``additional information" should be considered a context-aware system. There are numerous system which simply would consider these ``additional information" as regular inputs. 

The above definition suffers from the following drawbacks. Firstly, it is an object centric view of the variables involved in a problem. Using context in solving a problem implies bringing in additional variables which bring more flexibility in solving the problem. Secondly, the new variables are statically linked. For solving every instance of that problem, the same variables are used. There is no way of reasoning which variable is interesting, and which is not. For example, in the above tour example, the weather variable is unnecessary in most cases, but is applicable in situations when bad weather influences the people's experience of the tour. 

\subsection{Relation Centric View}
We believe that any context is any event or entity which can be \textit{related} to the variables in a problem. It must be noted that focus has now shifted from finding objects which are of a specific type, and that to objects (of any type), but related to the problem variables through specific relationship types.

\subsection{Temporal Relevance}
The relations between problem variables and the context objects must be temporal in nature. There are two advantages to this. First, this allows us to associate different context objects (possibly of different types) to different instances of the problem. Second, real world relations are always temporal in nature. By explicitly modeling time in our definition of context, we are able to incorporate a majority of real world relations, which are very crucial in real world applications.

\subsection{Dynamic Linking}
When a problem uses a fixed set of context objects for all instances, we refer to it as static linking. But here argument would be -- why call it context? and not just a problem which uses an additional set of variables. In this dissertation, we believe that context must be \textbf{dynamically linked} to the problem variables. This follows from the above two points. For example, tagging faces in photos cannot restrict the search space to be just friends of the user on Facebook. 

In summary, we can say that context is any information which can be dynamically related to information present in the given problem, under the accepted spatio-temporal constraints.

\subsection{Context-Awareness}
Given the above properties of context, we define a system which is context aware as one, which when given access to different sources of additional information, has the capability to select information to reduce the complexity of the original problem.

In this dissertation, we will see one such way of selecting such information for a specific face tagging application. In this work, we use event semantics and sources to specify our relations and context respectively.

Also, context has been used in many non-real world problems. For instance, in natural language processing [CITE], ranking pages of the web [CITE-pagerank], entity resolution [CITE], face clustering [CITE] and therefore it must not mean that contextual techniques must apply only to real world problems. For the purposes of this dissertation, we ignore the application of context in such problems.

\section{Parallels}

In this section, we look at how context awareness has explained many of the long standing problems in different communities.

\subsection{Black Swans}
In his widely acclaimed book, The Black Swan, Nassim Nicholas Taleb presents many arguments against solely relying on prediction based techniques. Citing examples from stock markets to clinical psychology trials he presents the case that historical evidence is insufficient to position oneself in the future. 

His example of a turkey brings to light an interesting point ``Consider a turkey that is fed every day. Every single feeding will firm up the bird's belief that it is the general rule of life to be fed every day by friendly members of the human race ``looking our for its best interest''. On the afternoon of the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, something unexpected will happen to the turkey. It will incur a revision of belief.''

Any amount of prediction is futile in this case. Taleb shows the graph showing the belief of the turkey in mankind. How could the turkey protect itself, yet reaping the benefits of the food given to it? 

From the standpoint of the turkey, the Wednesday event is a Black Swan event. But from the standpoint of the butcher, it is not, since its occurrence is not unexpected.

The simple example shows how new objects bring with them different semantics. And highlights that object relations can be disrupted heavily with even the slight change in relations. The second thing it shows is the need for awareness in the turkey to ``look-out'' for potential causes of harm. This action of being context-awareness is criticial in any real world systems.

\subsection{Polynesian Tribes}
Finding why such closely related tribes could evolve so differently in such a short time?

\subsection{The Gaia Hypothesis}
Charles Darwin's work describes how living being have evolved over billions on years. But it does not answer the question -- how does life sustain itself on Earth? It turns out that the few billion years of life we have had is too little to let life have grown randomly, and just let natural selection determine who succeeds. There had to be bigger factors which let life sustain and grow in specific ways.

One of the theories proposed in the 1970s is commonly known as the Gaia Theory. Proposed by James Lovelock and Lynn Margulis, it proposes the presence of feedback loops to explain the sustanence of life. Their argument is that for life to sustain, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere must not exceed a certain threshold. But who keeps this in check? How has the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere been almost constant for the last millions of years. Their reasoning is as follows:

The Earth's volcanoes have spewed out huge amounts of carbon dioxide for millions of years. Plant and animals recycle massive amounts of CO2 in the process of photosynthesis, respiration and decay. According to the Gaia theory, the excess of CO2 is recycled is removed and recycled by a vast feedback loop, which involves rock weathering as a key ingredient. In the process of rock weathering, rocks, rainwater and CO2 form chemicals known as carbonates which are taken out of the atomosphere and bound in liquid solutions. It turns out that soil bacteria vastly increases the rate of rock weathering. The carbonates are then washed down where tiny algae invisble to the naked eye, absorb them and use them to make shells of chalk. So the CO2 that was in the atmosphere has now ended up in the shells of those minute algae. In addition, ocean algae also absorb CO2 from the ocean.  

When the algae die their shells are then washed down into the ocean, where they form sediments of limestone. Limestone is very heavy, and gradually sinks into the mantle of the earth. Eventually, some of the CO2 is released back to the atomsphere by volcanoes. The entire cycle -- linking volcanoes to rock weathering, to soil bacteria, to oceanic algae, to limestone sediments, and back to volcanoes -- acts as a feedback loop which regulates the Earth's temperature. As the sun gets hotter, the bacteria in the soil get hotter, and more CO2 is removed from the atmosphere and sent to the ocean, thus cooling the planet.

This remarkable explanation involves rocks, bacteria and ocean dynamics and the even the sun to explain how a simple thing as the earth's temperature is regulated. By studying one or more objects in isolation makes the analysis far from complete. More interestingly, the relations between the objects are very precise, involving biochemical reactions and have very precise definitions.

\section{Event Context}
Our justification for the use of context begins with the statement: \textit{For a given user, the correctness of face tags for a photograph containing people she has never met is undefined}. This observation prepares us to understand what context is, and how contextual reasoning assists in tagging photos. The description of any problem domain requires a set of abstract data types, and a model of how these types are related to each other. We \textbf{define} contextual types as those which are semantically different from these data types, but can be directly or indirectly related to them via an extended model which encapsulates the original one. Contextual reasoning assists in the following two ways. \textbf{First}, contextual data restricts the number of people who might appear in the photographs. We can also argue that all the personal data of a user (her profile on Facebook, LinkedIn, email exchanges, phone call logs) provides a reasonable estimate of all these people who might appear in her photos. \textbf{Second}, by reasoning on abstractions in the contextual domain, we can infer conclusions on the original problem. We exploit this property to develop our algorithm in the later sections. Though CueNet can be applied to a variety of recognition problems, we focus on tagging people in personal photos for concreteness, where, the image and person tag form the abstractions in the problem domain. The types used in the contextual domain, but not limited to, are the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Events}: includes description of events like conferences, parties, trips or weddings, and their structure (for example, what kind of sessions, talks and keynotes are occurring within a particular conference).
\item \textbf{Social Relationships}: information about a user's social graph, people whom she corresponds with using email and other messaging services.
\item \textbf{Geographical Proximity}: various tools like Facebook Places, Google Latitude or Foursquare provide information about where people are at a given time.
\end{itemize}

The above classes of contextual data can be obtained from a variety of data sources. Examples of data sources range from mobile phone call logs and email conversations to Facebook messages to a listing of public events at upcoming.com. We classify sources into the following types:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Personal Data Sources}: include all sources which provide details about the particular user whose photo is to be tagged. Some common examples of personal data sources include Google Calendar, Email and Facebook profile and social graph.
\item \textbf{Social Data Sources}: include all sources which provide contextual information about a user's friends and colleagues. For example, LinkedIn, Facebook and DBLP are some of the commonly used websites with different types of social graphs.
\item \textbf{Public Data Sources}: include all sources which provide information about public organizations (like restaurants, points of interest or football stadiums) or about public events (like fairs, concerts or sports games).
\end{itemize}

Social and public data sources are enormous in size, containing information about billions of events and entities. Trying to use them directly will lead to scalability problems faced by face recognition and verification techniques. But, by using personal data, we can discover which parts of social and public sources are more relevant. For example, if a photo was taken at San Francisco, CA (where the user lives) his family in China is less relevant. Thus, the role of personal information is twofold. \textbf{Firstly}, it provides contextual information regarding the photo. \textbf{Secondly}, it acts as a bridge to connect to social and public data sources to discover interesting people connected to the user who might be present in the event and therefore, the photo.

At this point we will mention the \textbf{temporal relevance} property of a data source. Given a stream of photos taken during a time interval, the source which contributed interesting context for a photo might not be equally useful for the one appearing next. This is because sources tend to focus on a specific set of event types or relationship types, and the two photos might be captured in different events or contains persons with whom the user maintains relations through different sources. For example, two photos taken at a conference might contain a user's friends in the first, but with advisers of these friends in the next. The friends might interact with the user through a social network, but their advisers might not. By using a source like DBLP, the relations between the adviser and friends can be discovered. We say that the temporal relevance of these context sources is \textbf{\textit{low}}. This requirement will play an important role in the design of our framework, as now, sources are not hardwired to photo, but instead need to be discovered gradually.

conclusion: by using events we get dynamic linking, temporal relevance and real world integration.



%\subsection{Zeno's Paradox}
% \textit{In the paradox of Achilles and the Tortoise, Achilles is in a footrace with the tortoise. Achilles allows the tortoise a head start of 100 metres, for example. If we suppose that each racer starts running at some constant speed (one very fast and one very slow), then after some finite time, Achilles will have run 100 metres, bringing him to the tortoise's starting point. During this time, the tortoise has run a much shorter distance, say, 10 metres. It will then take Achilles some further time to run that distance, by which time the tortoise will have advanced farther; and then more time still to reach this third point, while the tortoise moves ahead. Thus, whenever Achilles reaches somewhere the tortoise has been, he still has farther to go. Therefore, because there are an infinite number of points Achilles must reach where the tortoise has already been, he can never overtake the tortoise.}

% How can achilles win? Idea: Ignoring a variable can make a process very hard to explain. Different variables work together holistically. In this case, it is time. Just by bringing it into the same picture the problem becomes tractable.
