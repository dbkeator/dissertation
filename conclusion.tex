\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}

Problems/Opportunities:

  1. Absence of a language/tool which can be used to express real world models. Ontologies are logic driven. Usually deal with true/false.

  2. Starting points of such a language -- physical variables, graphics world modeling, entity identification.

  3. Backtracking based algorithms.
