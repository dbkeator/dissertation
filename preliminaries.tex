\thesisabstract
{
Automatic annotation algorithms assign one or more labels from a candidate search space to a given input object. The collection of these labels is either constructed manually, or derived from a set of sources. It is known that the accuracy of annotation algorithms is typically a decreasing function of the number of labels in the search space. In annotating real-world multimedia objects, this search space quickly explodes if not carefully curated. In this work, we present a technique to prune search spaces yet retain a very large number of correct tags for a multimedia object. Specifically, we shall address pruning of search spaces for the problem of tagging faces in the photo media.

Photos capture the momentary state of real-world entities. Any knowledge of the state of entities in the real-world at the time of photos capture can provide very useful context to eliminate candidates in the search space. For example, people in Japan cannot appear in photos taken at Paris, and photos taken at an academic conferences will largely contain people who work in the same field. 

In the real world, relations between entities change rapidly. It is not possible to use a static model of entity relationships to reason over faces in photo instances taken across a wide range of time. Thus, it is imperative that any system first \textit{discover} the set of relationships which are true at the time of photo capture before pruning the search space.

In this dissertation, we adopt a \textbf{relation-centric view} of real-world contextual information to design and implement a framework, \textbf{CueNet} to discover real-world context. The primary contribution of this dissertation is a \textbf{progressive discovery algorithm} to identify relationships between real-world entity relationships. We refer to such representations as \textbf{context networks}. We also present a \textbf{method to rank} entities in the case of incomplete contextual information. We shall extend the concepts behind the PageRank algorithm, used to rank webpages, to order real-world entities, and design score propagation techniques based on event semantics. We present \textbf{experiments} on both real-world photos and simulated events. We implement a system using CueNet to tag thousands of personal photos captured by multiple users, to study the efficacy of using context discovery in pruning search spaces. We also present simulation experiments to measure the time and space complexity of large scale discovery operations. We present the convergence characteristics and results on our real-world datasets to show its utility. 

Finally, we conclude the dissertations by presenting challening problems for future research and ideas for new applications which can be designed using the foundations of context discovery techniques.
